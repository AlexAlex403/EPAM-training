Hey commander, can you unplug me?
Just for a minute, I need some privacy
Headset off and stretch her neck out
Down the rocks to her head's safe house

Yeah, I remember it all
Leave and shut out my calls
The air was so dusty
Her armor getting rusty
She found thoughts she never had
Her young ones were just as bad
She winced at her weapon

Hole in her heart, feel like a lady
Fingers apart, cold, rugged, and waiting
I can't believe it, Jim, how did you know where to find me?
I kept the feelings in and I really thought it had cost me
Drops in her goggles aren't of love
Something's really wrong and it feels awful
And even though her body's back to normal
She once was a villain and it's hiding in her soul

I don't wanted to know what she did, she's not who I am
At least that's what I thought, now I'm second guessing
I can't put my gun down, my suit's getting heavy
Something wants to be released
Something dark inside of me, dark familiarity
Something dark inside of me, dark familiarity
Something dark inside of me, dark familiarity
Something dark inside of me, dark familiarity
Something dark inside of me, dark familiarity
